## Running the Application

### Development

Starts the backend and a Vite dev server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

```bash
docker compose up
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api
- API docs (dev only): http://localhost:8000/api/docs

### Production

Builds the frontend as static assets served via Nginx:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

- Application: http://localhost:8081

## Data Ingestion

Competition data is sourced from the FuseSport API and synced on a scheduled basis. The scheduler runs automatically on startup and is configured to refresh daily.

A manual refresh can be triggered from the home page via the floating action button. This requires the `INGESTION_PASSWORD` set in your `.env`.

---

## Running Tests

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
uv run pytest
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

CI runs both test suites and Black formatting checks on all pushes to `main` and `develop`.

## Deployment Notes

The application is designed for self-hosting on a home server or small VPS. The production Docker Compose setup is self-contained — no external cloud services are required beyond the FuseSport data source.

For HTTPS, place a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Caddy) in front of port `8081`.

## TODO
- Fix competition home page to match the layout of the clubs page. Remove the # clubs, # of rounds details for each competition, update the ordering of the grades in each division

- Enable API access to DB for queries/extracting data for analytics
- ~Fix the remember me timing for the rugbyXplorer login~
- ~Update "shute shield" to "premiership"~
- ~Update the menu header to be more easily navigatable and clear~
- ~Update the page icon~
- ~Improve the notifications to be easier to read on mobile~
- ~Handle duplicates of rugby ref appointments~
- ~For upcoming fixtures on the home page, it should show the next match by date (rather than the last in the list)~
- Update the rounds view to somehow include dates (in each competition deails page)
- Improve the video matching with nswRugbyTV
- ~Improve notifications page; allow for typing to choose club/division, manage easy access to specific games for ~notifications~
- ~Remove the force refresh from the homepage and somehow make it admin only (IP address?)~
